Program to simulate the different CPU scheduling algorithms. Four
scheduling algorithms should be implemented in the program: [25 pts]
1. First In First Out (FIFO)
2. Shortest Job First (SJF)
3. Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
4. Round Robin (RR)

where each process has:
● Process ID: A unique identifier for the process.
● Arrival Time: The time at which the process arrives in the ready queue.
● Burst Time: The total time required by the process for execution.
● Time Quantum (TQ): The value of TQ should only be used in RR.

For each scheduling algorithm, the order of execution of processes and the scheduling policy's Average Response Time and
Average Turnaround Time is displayed
